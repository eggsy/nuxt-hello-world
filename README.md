# Nuxt Hello World

⚡️ Lightning fast, and advanced Nuxt.js module for those who want to see "hello world" in their console every time they change a page, or start their Nuxt server.

Just add it to your `nuxt.config.js`file:

```js
export default {
  buildModules: ["nuxt-hello-world"],
};
```

You'll see a new badge displaying when you run your Nuxt app, that means the module is working correctly.
